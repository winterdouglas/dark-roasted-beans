## Generating the icons

- It's possible to use https://react-svgr.com/playground/?icon=true&native=true&typescript=true to generate the SVG components
- If the icon needs to respect dynamic colors, remove any colors that are in it
- Preferably import the icons in 24x24 for consistency
- Use currentColor for color replacement
- More documentation can be found here: https://github.com/software-mansion/react-native-svg/blob/main/USAGE.md
